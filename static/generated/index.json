    "prompt": "Straight-on wide shot inside a modern coastal cafe: a large textured plaster wall in cool blue tones with natural morning window light creating a subtle top-to-bottom shift from lighter blue near the ceiling to deeper blue near the floor. Minimal decor: a simple wooden bench and a small leafy plant on the far left. One casually dressed customer in plain clothing walks by at the far right, slight motion blur. Ample negative space on the wall. Soft, airy mood, natural light, shallow depth of field, eye-level, 35mm. No screens, no devices, no signage, no posters, no whiteboards, no logos, no text anywhere.",
